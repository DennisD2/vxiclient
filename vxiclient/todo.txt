- Add all missing methods to Boundaries not yet implemented (see Device code)
 This means real testing and real measurements. DO this one by one device:
  - HP1300 boundary completion
  - HP1300Pacer boundary completion
  - HP1326 boundary completion
  - HP1330 boundary completion
  - HP1333 boundary completion
  - HP1340 boundary completion
 
- Hp1330 test fails (get returns always true for bits)
- Fix Definite Block Length code, See TODO
- Throw away methods in ConversionUtil (see @deprecated)
- Frontend: Fix Pacer menu label and default selection

Done

  - Add methods to get each device by its name (e.g. 'hp1330') - OK
- Serial... in DeviceLink, the primary/secondary address must be located
- Serial implement getSec/Prime Address from String in correct way, see TODO
- Extend Configuration and Connectors to have multiple "device-connections"
- RPC Connector: cache all created DeviceLinks
- HP1340: writeWaveformValues_DampedSine_DAC_ArbBlock does not compile
- Fix issue with device type. See ConnectionManager TODO around line 75.
- Extend REST code
