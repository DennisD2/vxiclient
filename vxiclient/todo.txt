- harmonize methods in ConversionUtil (see @deprecated)
- Check methods in CommunicationUtil where they should go. maybe stay there :-)
- Hp1330 test fails at least for RPC

Done
----

- Write SerialToGPIBConnector (much work)
- Extend config to allow multiple devices per connector - OK
  - Add methods to get each device by its name (e.g. 'hp1330') - OK
