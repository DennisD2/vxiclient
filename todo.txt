- Hp1330 test fails (get returns always true for bits)
- HREF setting in app-project: Make frontend copy into app project better or BETTER: add it to build like in old web project!
  SpringBoot has some automatism for additional property files.
- Improve copying of resources; see app pom, there its just copied to target/classes/resources. Check if
- Make multimeter view/service work without hardware switches
- Add all missing methods to Boundaries not yet implemented (see Device code)
 This means real testing and real measurements. Do this one by one device:
  - HP1300 boundary completion
  - HP1300Pacer boundary completion
  - HP1326 boundary completion
  - HP1330 boundary completion

- Fix Definite Block Length code, See TODO
- Throw away methods in ConversionUtil (see @deprecated)
- Frontend: Fix Pacer menu label and default selection

- Write SerialToGPIBConnector (much work)
- Extend config to allow multiple devices per connector - OK
  - Add methods to get each device by its name (e.g. 'hp1330') - OK
- Serial... in DeviceLink, the primary/secondary address must be located
- Serial implement getSec/Prime Address from String in correct way, see TODO
- Extend Configuration and Connectors to have multiple "device-connections"
- RPC Connector: cache all created DeviceLinks
- HP1340: writeWaveformValues_DampedSine_DAC_ArbBlock does not compile
- Fix issue with device type. See ConnectionManager TODO around line 75.
- Extend REST code
  - HP1333 boundary completion
  - HP1340 boundary completion
